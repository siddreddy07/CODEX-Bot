It looks like the changes were made in the most recent commit.\n\nHere's a comparison of the changes with the actual code:\n\n**Before:**\n```javascript\nfunction hello() {\n  console.log('Hello From New World')\n}\nhello()\n```\n**After:**\n```javascript\nfunction showCurrentTime() {\n  const now = new Date();\n  console.log(` Current Time: ${now.toLocaleString()}`);\n}\nshowCurrentTime();\n```\nAs you can see, the `hello` function was replaced with a new function called `showCurrentTime`. The new function logs the current time to the console in a formatted way, whereas the old function simply logged a greeting message.\n\nIf we look at the actual code, we can see that the `showCurrentTime` function is defined and called at the end of the file. The function uses the `Date` object to get the current time and logs it to the console using `console.log`.\n\nThe changes made in the recent two commits seem to be focused on updating the `script.js` file to display the current time instead of a simple greeting message. The code looks clean and well-organized, and the changes seem to be functional.\n\nDoes this comparison help you understand the changes made to the `script.js` file?"

This function takes a `folderpath` as an argument and is designed to generate documentation for JavaScript files within that folder.\n\nHere's a high-level overview of what the code does:\n\n1. It checks if the provided folder exists, and if not, it logs an error message and returns.\n2. It reads the contents of the folder and filters out only the JavaScript files.\n3. For each JavaScript file, it reads the file content, generates a unique hash for the code, and checks if the hash has changed since the last time the file was processed.\n4. If the hash has changed, it uses an AI model (imported from `../models/llamamodel.js`) to generate documentation for the code.\n5. It then writes the generated documentation to a Markdown file with the same name as the original JavaScript file, but with a `.md` extension instead of `.js`.\n6. Finally, it updates a cache file (`cache.json`) with the new hash values for each processed file.\n\nThe code also includes some helper functions, such as `getjsfiles` to filter out JavaScript files, `readFileContent` to read the contents of a file, `getMeaningfulCode` to remove comments and collapse whitespace, and `getSmartHash` to generate a unique hash for the code.\n\nOverall, the `generatedocs` function appears to be a custom implementation for generating documentation for JavaScript code using an AI model. It's quite an interesting approach to automating documentation!\n\nIs there anything specific you'd like to know or discuss about this code?"
